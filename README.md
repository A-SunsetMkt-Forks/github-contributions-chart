# :octocat: Github Contribution Chart Generator

Generates an image of all your Github contributions since you have signed up, so you can use it in social media.

The API for this project [lives here](https://github.com/sallar/github-contributions-api) which is also written by me since Github doesn't provide a way to access user statistics through it's official API.
